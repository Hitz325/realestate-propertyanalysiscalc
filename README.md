  -------------

TMI-TME=MCF
Annual Cash Flow(ACF) = MCF*12

**Fourth Square**

The purpose of this project is for the form to take in the following figures and then produce a percentage representing the cash-on-cash return on investment of a residential income property. 

In the future I would like to make this project persistent so that the user can go back and compare to previous analyses. Possibly considering authenitcation and bringing in some google API's to show addresses on a map.
